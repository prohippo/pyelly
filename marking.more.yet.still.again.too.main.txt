He and his family later moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he attended St. Mary of the Assumption School. He studied at Seton Hall University in South Orange, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (1923) and Master of Arts (1925).

He earned his Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Propaganda that year as well.
Upon his return to New Jersey in 1927, he served as professor of Sacred Scripture and homiletics at Immaculate Conception Seminary until 1941, when he became spiritual director and professor of ascetical theology. He was raised to the rank of a Papal Chamberlain in May 1941 and later a Domestic Prelate in December 1949. In 1953 he was named pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows Church in South Orange.
