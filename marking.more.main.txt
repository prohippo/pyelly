Francois Hollande has said France will welcome 24,000 refugees as part of an EU-wide plan that "can and will" bring the crisis under control.
Speaking at the start of a live TV press conference, the French president said his country has a duty to take in those fleeing war and persecution, and is ready to do so.
His comments came as David Cameron prepared to outline Britain's plan to tackle the refugee crisis.
The Prime Minister was expected to say that the UK would take "thousands" more asylum-seekers as part of a "fundamental rethink" of its role as a place of refuge.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Tuesday she is "sorry" for using a private email server, going further than ever before to express remorse for the controversy that has rocked her campaign.
"I'm sorry about that," Clinton said in an at-times emotional interview on ABC News' "World News Tonight with David Muir," acknowledging that she should have used separate accounts for work and personal business. "I take responsibility and I am trying to be as transparent as I possibly can."
Clinton later issued a slightly different apology in the interview, saying she was "sorry that it has raised all these questions."

Tesla’s Model S P85D acts like a car built on the mantra “Waiting is for suckers.” This 691-hp battery-electric vehicle is for the impatient, the toe tappers, and the watch checkers. Tesla claims that the P85D is capable of reaching 60 mph in 3.2 seconds, shaving 1.4 seconds from the rear-drive P85 it replaces. To get down to that number, Tesla added a 221-hp electric motor to drive the front wheels. This secondary unit works in conjunction with the P85D’s 470-hp rear motor to provide four-wheel drive. A similar two-motor setup will be available on all Model S versions starting this spring, and the upcoming Model X SUV also will share the system. But for now, the most snow-friendly Tesla is the top-shelf P85D.

But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.
