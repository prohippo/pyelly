Francois Hollande has said France will welcome 24,000 refugees as part of an EU-wide plan that "can and will" bring the crisis under control.
Speaking at the start of a live TV press conference, the French president said his country has a duty to take in those fleeing war and persecution, and is ready to do so.
His comments came as David Cameron prepared to outline Britain's plan to tackle the refugee crisis.
The Prime Minister was expected to say that the UK would take "thousands" more asylum-seekers as part of a "fundamental rethink" of its role as a place of refuge.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Tuesday she is "sorry" for using a private email server, going further than ever before to express remorse for the controversy that has rocked her campaign.
"I'm sorry about that," Clinton said in an at-times emotional interview on ABC News' "World News Tonight with David Muir," acknowledging that she should have used separate accounts for work and personal business. "I take responsibility and I am trying to be as transparent as I possibly can."
Clinton later issued a slightly different apology in the interview, saying she was "sorry that it has raised all these questions."
